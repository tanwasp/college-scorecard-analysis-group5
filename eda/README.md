This notebook includes data exploration, cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations.

The primary outcome variables in this research include the loan default rate among Pell Grant recipients, the percentage of Pell recipients at each institution, the amount of loan debt taken on by Pell students, their post-graduation earnings, and the loan repayment completion rate. These variables  measure the financial outcomes and burdens experienced by Pell students and are aligned with the goals of the analysis. For instance, default and repayment rates offer insight into financial stress , while earnings and debt levels help assess return on investment across institution types. These outcomes are expected to differ between HBCUs and non-HBCUs due to differences in  institutional resources. The key explanatory variable across all questions is the university type, specifically, whether an institution is an HBCU or not. Other important explanatory factors include the studentâ€™s field of study, and the amount of loan debt when evaluating its relationship to repayment or earnings outcomes. Together, these variables help us perform comprehensive comparison of financial outcomes for Pell Grant students across different kind of instutions.
